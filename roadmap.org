** DONE play one audiofile using gstreamer
   CLOSED: [2022-07-08 Fri 16:18]
** TODO get list of available audiocards
   - alsa will show too many variants
   - use PulseAudio
** TODO programmatically choose audiocard
   - gstreamer can not do it
   - I have to switch output using PulseAudio (what about Windows?)
** TODO run two audio-files in two different audiocards
** TODO change audiocard while audio is playing
